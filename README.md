This is an 'updated' version of OpenIVs openCameraV plugin.

This plugin removes the camera distance limits in the Rockstar Editor so you can move your camera anywhere without hitting the red 'out of bounds' barrier.

How to install the plugin:
1. Download the "openCameraV_b2802.asi" and extract the .zip to your desktop.
2. Open the "FiveM Application Data" folder and navigate to the "plugins" folder. If you don't have a plugins folder, create one.
3. Drag & drop the "openCameraV_b2802.asi" into the plugins folder and you should be good to go.

- 1604
- 2060
